# Pre-Charge State Machine

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a pre-charge state machine. The pre-charge state machine is used in electric vehicle battery management systems to safely manage the initial charging process of the battery.

## Repository Structure

- **Datas/**: Contains data files relevant to the project.
- **Diagrams/**: Includes diagrams that illustrate the state machine and its operation.
- **LTSpice/**: Contains LTSpice simulation files for the pre-charge circuit.
- **TwinCAT - project/**: Holds the TwinCAT project files for PLC implementation.
- **RAPPORT** : Contains the report of the project which was an internship at the company "Flanders Make".

## Getting Started
